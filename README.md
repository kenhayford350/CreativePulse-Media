📖 About the Project
This project was prepared as part of a Data Analyst simulation interview for CreativePulse Media, a growing B2B digital media agency in Abuja specializing in social media marketing, content creation, and digital advertising for SMBs.

The task involved analyzing campaign performance data to demonstrate how data-driven insights can help the company retain clients, optimize digital campaigns, and show clear ROI.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze Business Challenges:
Understand why clients are leaving and how data can help demonstrate campaign effectiveness.

Develop a Data-Driven Approach:
Identify key metrics, recommend strategies, and suggest dashboard tools for campaign optimization.

Present Insights:
Create a clear, non-technical 5-minute pitch highlighting the value of hiring a Data Analyst.
